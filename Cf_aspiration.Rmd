This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#load data uganda
load("data_uganda.rda")
```


```{r packages, fig.show='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, results='hide'}

#Load libraries
library(grf)
library(haven)
library(caret)
library(tidyverse) 
library(expss)
#library(summarytools)
library(mice)

```

Split data to train and test

```{r}
N <- nrow(data_uganda)
# Calculate how many rows 75% of N should be and print it; we use round to get an integer
target <- round(N * 0.75)
# Create the vector of N uniform random variables: rv
rv <- runif(N)
# Use rv to create the training set: ud_train (75% of data) and ud_test (25% of data)
uganda_train <- data_uganda[rv < 0.75, ]
uganda_test <- data_uganda[rv >= 0.75, ]
# Use nrow() to examine ud_train and ud_test
nrow(uganda_train)
nrow(uganda_test)
```

Generate matrixes

```{r}

# Random seed to reproduce results
set.seed

# Create outcome and inputs for the Causal Forests (important all numeric; including dummy code the factor variables)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
