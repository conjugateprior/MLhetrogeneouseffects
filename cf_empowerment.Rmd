Split data to train and test

```{r}
N <- nrow(data_uganda)
# Calculate how many rows 75% of N should be and print it; we use round to get an integer
target <- round(N * 0.75)
# Create the vector of N uniform random variables: rv
rv <- runif(N)
# Use rv to create the training set: ud_train (75% of data) and ud_test (25% of data)
uganda_train <- data_uganda[rv < 0.75, ]
uganda_test <- data_uganda[rv >= 0.75, ]
# Use nrow() to examine ud_train and ud_test
nrow(uganda_train)
nrow(uganda_test)

In order for conditional average treatment effects to be properly identified, a datasetâ€™s propensity scores must be bounded away from 0 and 1. A simple way to validate this assumption is to calculate the propensity scores by regressing the treatment assignments W against X, and examining the out-of-bag predictions. Concretely, you can perform the following steps:
If there is strong overlap, the histogram will be concentrated away from 0 and 1. If the data is instead concentrated at the extremes, the overlap assumption likely does not hold.

```{r}
propensity.forest = regression_forest(X_baseline, W_treatment)
W.hat.p = predict(propensity.forest)$predictions
hist(W.hat.p, xlab = "propensity score")
```


```{r}
#after training a raw model with all baseline variables, it is recommended to train additional model only with important variable
##check for variable importance
varimp = variable_importance(cf.raw)
selected.idx = which(varimp > mean(varimp)) #select only important variables and train another causal forest using only important variables

#train a causal forest only with selected variables

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
